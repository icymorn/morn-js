morn-js
=======

This is a javascript toolkit library.

It has some useful functions. For example:

* chain function.
* selector : morn.id('id'), morn.tag('tagname'), or morn('#id tagname .class').
* event add and remove.
* create dom, append, prepend.

and even more.

some ui plugins:

* resize

I will continue working on it.
